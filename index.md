## Summary
I’m looking for a job as a machine perception specialist in robotics. 

I'm eager to contribute to the next revolution in mobility and what might be the most profoundly impactful technological advancement: self-driving cars. With multiple years of experience in software development, as well as team leadership, and demonstrable communication skills, I have much to offer and embrace the challenge in pivoting my career toward artificial intelligence and robotics. 

I think allowing machines to see will unlock the revolution in AI. I want to be a part of that revolution.

**Technologies**: C++, OpenCV, Eigen, Python, Tensorflow, Keras.
